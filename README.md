# Pack Channels - Houdini Digital Asset
This hda helps simplify the process of storing attribute data to vertex channels or textures for use in realtime applications.

To build the hda yourself you can run packChannelsHDA.py with hython (a specialised python interpreter that is installed with houdini).
